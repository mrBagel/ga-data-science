Facebook.com/SocialTeesAnimalRescue and Socialteesnyc.org\n\nSTAFF FAVORITE!!! We all like a good love story, don't we? Sasha is in a foster home with three cats, one of which is a foster cat that has fallen absolutely madly in love with him and follows him everywhere he goes. She curls up next to him when he lies in his dog bed, she rubs herself against his face and tries to climb under his chin, and she cleans his face and ears as though he were her giant kitten. Her name is Princess, she's about 3 years old, and she's grown so wildly attached to him that we can't bare to separate them and break her heart... So these two need a home together. (Princess is VERY friendly, loves to lie in your lap, and is great with other cats and obviously dogs.) \n\nNow back to Sasha. Sasha was born with what we call 'the happy gene.' He's relentlessly upbeat, sweet, and innocent. He's a forever puppy in the most wonderful kind of way. Sasha is 3 years old, 55 pounds, extremely housebroken, and doesn't chew anything ever (except the stuff he's supposed to chew like dog bones). He's excellent with cats and awesome with most other dogs.\nSasha walks well on a leash and is learning his basic training and commands. He's amazingly low key inside -- he just lies around and sleeps all day, and he'll try to lay his head on your lap while you watch TV or work on your laptop if you'll let him. He's a big snuggle bug and loves to curl up in bed with you... also if you'll let him. Sasha is a good guard dog and would do really well outside the city with a yard to frolic, roam around, and relax in. When he runs in a fenced in area, it's the most hysterical and stress relieving thing you could imagine watching -- he puts his head down low and just zooms gleefully in circles around and around and around. You can practically see happiness shooting out of his body. He's an incredible athlete and loves to be chased by his doggy friends, darting in and out of benches and trees. Sasha is as fast as a cheetah, and spotted like one, too! He's ridiculously handsome. Everywhere he goes he gets compliments up the wazoo.\nIdeally, Sasha would do best in a home with a big fenced in yard, another dog who can be his best doggy friend, and maybe some room for a very loving, smitten cat. He would do really well with a small energetic dog that would chase him around the yard and play wrestle with him. \n\n\nTHIS DOG IS NOT AT SOCIAL TEES AT 325 EAST 5TH STREET.

This 8-year-old girl is just looking for a loving family that will give her the kisses and affection she deserves. She is very relaxed, great with other dogs and cats, and friendly with all people she meets. After we rescued this girl from the kill shelter, we learned that she was diabetic. She's now getting the proper care and nutrition she's needed for a long time, and she needs to go to a family that is prepared to provide her with the daily monitoring and medication she requires. She's a little extra work because of her condition, but she's SO worth it!! Daisy is sweeter and more loving than you can imagine. She has low exercise needs and loves nothing more than to relax and cuddle. Her foster mom says: \"She is AMAZING. She does so many funny little things like kicks her back legs the whole time I'm preparing their meals. She is always at my feet, and just wants to cuddle everyone, the sweetest little nose nudge to get right under your arms when you are sitting on the couch with her.

A little clumsy and doofy ;p  He listens and behaves so well (unless he thinks he can sneak some food off your plate when you're not looking). He loves to play and go on walks and then sleep a few hours. He's a big boy with long legs so he likes to run too.  Zayden likes to cuddle and be around people. He is friendly with everyone!  He gets a little excited when passing other dogs but gets over it quick with a little tug of the leash. He does get along with other pups. Was sitting my friends pitbull last week and they are now best friends!  He's good with kids too and loves their attention. He loves long walks and trips to the park and would do great in a home with a yard.\"\n\n\nTHIS DOG IS NOT AT SOCIAL TEES AT 325 EAST 5TH STREET.

She is 63 lbs and 5 years old, a mellow but playful young adult with lots of love to give and many years of loyalty to her beloved people ahead of her. Ladybird is a major cuddle bug, very well behaved, and great with everyone and other dogs. She has a stunning black and tan coat! Her foster mom says: \"Lady Bird is a sweet and elegant Treeing walker Coonhound mix. A steadfast companion, she is eager to spend time with her family members, yet she is independent, confident and loving with everyone she meets. She is fully house-trained and would make a wonderful addition to an active family, single person or couple, ideally outside of the city and/or with an owner who enjoys bringing their dog along on outdoor activities. When alone at home, she sleeps. Great with dogs, cats and children. Our two year old son loves her! He hugs her around the waist, leans on her, follows her around and climbs into her bed with her. She is SO tolerant and gentle. \nShe has had no accidents, her bladder control is incredible. Also good to know is that she sleeps quietly all night in her bed.\"\n\n\nTHIS DOG IS NOT AT SOCIAL TEES AT 325 EAST 5TH STREET.

She is yet another one of those very poorly cared for animals whose magical, ever trusting spirit burns bright. Princess is very low key and a little slow moving, friendly with everyone and loves affection. Just needs a little guidance during walks.Her foster mom says: \"This pretty girl is super sweet! She’s friendly with everyone she meets, despite not being able to see them. She’s very mellow and quiet. She’s good with other dogs and ignores cats. She is getting more comfortable around the house, and knows to do her business outside. We have started taking walks on a leash, and although she is slow now, I expect her to get more comfortable with time and consistency. She can be fearful of new situations, but never barks or complains. Even though she needs some extra guidance, it has been so rewarding watching her blossom!”\n\n\nTHIS DOG IS NOT AT SOCIAL TEES AT 325 EAST 5TH STREET.

He is about a year old and 16 pounds, but he is pretty overweight and should only be about 10. This little chunker needs a healthy diet and some gentle exercise! He was found stray completely matted, so he's had a lovely little grooming that has left him quite bald and pink looking. He is absolutely adorable in a pig-like sort of way, but use your imagination for a second -- in a few months, he'll be white, fluffy, and lean! We love him just the way he is, but he will be much happier and healthier. Papi is a very friendly little guy, great with everyone he meets and other dogs and cats. He loves to be rubbed and massaged, and he really enjoys cuddling in your lap on the floor or couch. He's just a glutton for affection! His foster mom says: \"Papi is so, so sweet and snuggly. He loves to be pet, he loves to sit on laps, he likes to go for walks. He is incredibly well-behaved -- totally housebroken, hasn't tried to chew up a shoe or gotten into any of our stuff. He's such a pleasure -- he's so friendly and sweet and loving. He's really curious about other dogs we pass, generally uninterested in cats and only interested in people if they're giving him attention.\"\n\n\nTHIS DOG IS NOT AT SOCIAL TEES AT 325 EAST 5TH STREET.
