## Data Mining Algorithms

* The algorithm I read about is Logistic Regression.
* The problem it solved is Classification. It predicts binary outputs for a target value.
* Logistic Regression is one of the Generalized Linear Model (GLM) using the logit link function and the binomial variance function. The algorithm will generate coefficients from the training set of predictors and targets for the model. Then given a set of new predictors the model will predict the binary outcome (in Log value).
* Appliccations:
  1. Use stats such as score, rebound, assist ect. to predict if an NBA team will win or lose game.
  2. Use data about the posts a user liked or disliked in his /her tumblr's dashboard such as post type (image, text, gif...), tag, author, ect. to decide the user will like or dislike a new post.
  3. Use patients heath data to predict the occurance of heartattck.
