## Peer Review 1

### Strengths of their project 
1. You did a very good job getting and cleaning this dataset. You took the effort to parse the datset that stored in folders and subfolders and explore external tools from github to reads the .h5 files into a dataframe. One suggestion is that you could probably use pd.to_tsv to export the cleaned dataset, so you can continue to bulid on analysis on it. Also it might be good to upload this clean dataset to your github so if other people are interested they can also work on it.

### Comments about things you think could be improved
1. I realized that in the case that the year is 0, the title of the song actually contains some information abut the year. For example, 'Christina The Astonishing (2010 Digital Remaster)' has year = 0, but I think use 2010 as year might be better than treated as NA.


## Questions about things you don't understand

## Comments about their code
1. I don't know if you realized that whenever you use matplotlib to plot year against some metrics, the year axes actually showd as integers instead of years. For example, 
        ```python
        fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=3,ncols=2)  
        axes[0,0].plot(year_gb.Loudness.mean()) 
        axes[0,0].set_ylabel("Loudness")
        ```
